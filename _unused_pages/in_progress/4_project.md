title: Flexible sensory processing in whole-brain circuits 
description: This is an ongoing research project investigating how the brain of larval zebrafish flexibly processes incoming sensory information. We use cross-decomposition methods (Reduced Rank Regression) to investigate how populations of neurons share information and ultimately drive behavior.

## Introduction
One of the main goals of my postdoc is to study how neural circuits are able to flexibly process incoming sensory information. For example, when we are asleep, how does our brain completely "tune out" sounds that we react and response to when we are awake? Presumably our ears still work and are providing information about the sound to our brain. But, somehow, the brain determines that the sound is not behaviorally relevant during a sleep state and that we do not need to take any action or even consciously perceive the sound. The goal of this research is to identify the neural circuit computations that underlie this type of flexible processing ability.

In this post, I provide a bird's eye view of the approach I have been taking to answer these types of questions and highlight some of my preliminary findings. Before getting into the data analysis and results, I first provide a general description of the experimental approach and the data. My goal is that, with this background information, the results will be interpretable to a general scientific and/or computational audience.

For those interested in digging a bit deeper, please feel free to check out my [poster](../../assets/pdf/fens_poster.pdf) on this topic which I recently presented at [FENS 2024](https://fensforum.org/) in Vienna.

## <a name="background"></a>Background

Cocktail party effect / motivation coming from PhD (refer to PhD projects) and cite other research. Need smaller system where you can see behavior / whole brain circuit at the same time.

Brief description of the standard behavior and the state-dependence in fish. Good model system.

## <a name="methods"></a>Experimental approach

Basically just explain the 2017 paper and cite it. Add a figure. Maybe also the supplemental movie of the imaging?

## <a name="data"></a>The data

Simple section. Show some raw data. Describe the number of neurons, number of trials etc. Show this graphically / cartoon-like. e.g., a matrix with neurons sorted by brain region.

## <a name="results"></a>Results

Identification of turn / visual responsive neurons.

Gain hypothesis / sum and threshold model.

Null-space model and reduced rank regression.

## <a name="future"></a>Future directions

Additional models (CCA / PLS).
Flexibly fit to incorporate state, rather than discreetly fitting.
Analyze single trial data (can neural activity predict behavior on single trials?)
