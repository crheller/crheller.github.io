Welcome to my homepage! I am currently in the process of completing my portfolio. Check back soon for further updates!

I am an experienced systems neuroscientist leveraging data science and machine learning techniques to study how large scale brain networks drive behavior.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [RoLi Lab](https://www.rolilab.com/) at [The Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/en) in Tuebingen, Germany. Prior to this, I completed my PhD in Neuroscience in the [Laboratory of Brain Hearing and Behavior](https://hearingbrain.org/) in Portland, Oregon.

A Minnesota native, I will be returning to the United States in the fall of 2024 and am actively searching for opportunities to apply my data science skills in the climate space. I am particularly interested in exploring the applications of machine learning in agriculture and energy, two areas where data-driven insights will be critical for ensuring the transition to a more sustainable future.

In my spare time I love being outdoors - cycling, hiking, and running.
