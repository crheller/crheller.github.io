### My plan for which projects to highlight

#### RoLi
* RRR poster results on communication
* Lab experimental database (reproducibility in science, thinking through data schema, Julia api, dashboard)
* Registration pipeline (highlight HPC afforded improvement, automated bash script generation, db integration, dashboard etc.)
* Sleep paper? If so, keep very vague -- identification of novel behavioral state

#### LBHB
* Noise correlation demo
* Pupil tracking (if SVD allows me to share some images)
* dDR
* eLife paper?

#### Fun
* Eigendecomposition
* KMeans
* PCA
* Matrix inversion
* PLS implementation
* RRR implementation
* Cross-decomposition (PLS vs. RRR vs. CCA)
* WIP - riff from PANGEO and Climate ai
